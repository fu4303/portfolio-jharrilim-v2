### Well, what is it?

GraphQL is a way to bring more control to cliemt applications by allowing
them to define their own queries (akin to GETs) and their own mutatioms
(akin to POSTs). By allowing the client to specify everything upfront,
you reduce network roundtrips.

### Alright, sounds cool, how do I use it?
