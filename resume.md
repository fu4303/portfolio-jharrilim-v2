## Lead Engineer

### Scotiabank, Toronto, Canada

**Aug 2019 - Present**

- Developed features for an internal Spring-based component library which addresses cross-cutting concerns and is in use by thousands of production API endpoints.
- Increased React application performance by lowering the time complexity of various algorithms and increased perceived performance with lazy rendering.
- Created responsive front-end application styling by leveraging CSS flex, grid, and media-queries.
- Wrote an algorithm for code generation targeting JPA specifications.
- Wrote a recursive table component to support circular/infinitely-recursive data structures with minimal performance impact.
- Used the React Profiler and Lighthouse for performance analysis, and kept the application running at top speed.
- Created and tested "spring-starter" like functionality for value-added features on top of Spring Cloud Sleuth.
- Migrated documentation generation for a Spring project to its own separate project to enable separate versioning and faster changes.
- Wrote an impact analysis for describing the severity and effort needed to resolve breaking changes for consumer teams.

## Technical Quality Assurance Analyst Co-op

### RBC, Toronto, Canada

**Jan 2017 - Apr 2017**

- Researched Open Source Service Virtualization tools. Chose Wiremock as the most optimal Service Virtualization tool and created a Java Spring Boot server which had the ability to boot multiple instances of Wiremock and provision them into server farms. This supported mutual SSL; nearly all the other choices did not. I used SonarQube for analyzing my code, and I tested my application with Junit and had approximately 90% test coverage.
